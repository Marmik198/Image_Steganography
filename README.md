# Image_Steganography

## Steps to encode, detect & decode

1.  Clone this git repository
    
    encode\_decode.py - 
        1. Encodes and Decodes the text into/from image.
        2. Detects the image steganography by left shifting the pixel RGB value.

2.  Copy image.png(original) and text.txt(text to hide) to resources folder

3.  Text will be converted to binary and will be encoded to image by dropping 4 LSB of image pixel bits value and copying text binary value in place.

5.  “image\_output.png“ (image with text hidden) will be generated in the resources folder.
